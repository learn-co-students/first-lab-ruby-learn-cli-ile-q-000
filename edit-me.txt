Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools their way to dusty death
Out! Out! brief candle
Life is but a passing shadow
A poor player who struts and frets his time upon the stage
And then is heard no more
It is a tale told by and idiot
Full of Sound and Fury
Signifying nothing.
